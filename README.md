# BrowserStack Examples TestNG

## Introduction

TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful.

This BrowserStack Example repository demonstrates a Selenium test framework written in TestNG with parallel testing capabilities. The Selenium test scripts are written for the open source [BrowserStack Demo web application](https://bstackdemo.com) ([Github](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-demo-app)). This BrowserStack Demo App is an e-commerce web application which showcases multiple real-world user scenarios. The app is bundled with offers data, orders data and products data that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

The Selenium tests are run on different platforms like on-prem, docker and BrowserStack using various run configurations and test capabilities.

## Test infrastructure environments

- [On-premise/self-hosted](#on-premise-self-hosted)
- [BrowserStack](#browserstack)

## Test Reporting

- [Allure reports](#generating-allure-reports)

---

# On Premise / Self Hosted

This infrastructure points to running the tests on your own machine using a browser (e.g. Chrome) using the browser's driver executables (e.g. ChromeDriver for Chrome). Selenium enables this functionality using WebDriver for many popular browsers.

## Prerequisites

- For this infrastructure configuration (i.e on-premise), ensure that the ChromeDriver executable is placed in the `/src/test/resources/drivers` folder.

Note: The ChromeDriver version must match the Chrome browser version on your machine.

## Running Your Tests

### Run a specific test on your own machine

- How to run the test?

  To run the default test scenario (e.g. End to End Scenario) on your own machine, use the following command:

  Maven:

  ```sh
  mvn clean test -P on-prem
  ```

  Gradle:

  ```sh
  gradle clean on-prem
  ```

  To run a specific test scenario, use the following command with the additional 'test' argument:

  Maven:

  ```sh
  mvn clean test -P on-prem -Dtest=LoginDataDrivenTest

  ```

  Gradle:

  ```sh
  gradle clean on-prem -Ptest-name=LoginDataDrivenTest
  ```

  where, the argument `test` or `test-name` can be any testclass implemented this repository.

- Output

  This run profile executes a specific test scenario on a single browser instance on your own machine.

### Run the entire test suite on your own machine

- How to run the test?

  To run the entire test suite on your own machine, use the following command:

  Maven:

  ```sh
  mvn clean test -P on-prem-suite
  ```

  Gradle:

  ```sh
  gradle clean on-prem-suite
  ```

- Output

  This run profile executes the entire test suite sequentially on a single browser, on your own machine.

# BrowserStack

[BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) provides instant access to 2,000+ real mobile devices and browsers on a highly reliable cloud infrastructure that effortlessly scales as testing needs grow.

## Prerequisites

- Create a new [BrowserStack account](https://www.browserstack.com/users/sign_up) or use an existing one.
- Identify your BrowserStack username and access key from the [BrowserStack Automate Dashboard](https://automate.browserstack.com/) and export them as environment variables using the below commands.

  - For \*nix based and Mac machines:

  ```sh
  export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<browserstack-username> &&
  export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=<browserstack-access-key>
  ```

  - For Windows:

  ```shell
  set BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<browserstack-username>
  set BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=<browserstack-access-key>
  ```

  Alternatively, you can also hardcode username and access_key objects in the [browserstack.yml](resources/conf/capabilities/browserstack.yml) file.

Note:

- We have configured a list of test capabilities in the [browserstack.yml](resources/conf/capabilities/browserstack.yml) file. You can certainly update them based on your device / browser test requirements.
- The exact test capability values can be easily identified using the [Browserstack Capability Generator](https://browserstack.com/automate/capabilities)

## Running Your Tests

### Run a specific test on BrowserStack

In this section, we will run a single test on Chrome browser on Browserstack. To change test capabilities for this configuration, please refer to the `bstack-single.yml` file.

- How to run the test?

    - For \*nix based and Mac machines:

    ```sh
    rm -f -- browserstack.yml
    ln src/test/resources/conf/capabilities/bstack-single.yml browserstack.yml
    ```

    - For Windows:

    ```sh
    del /f "browserstack.yml" && copy /y .\src\test\resources\conf\capabilities\bstack-single.yml browserstack.yml
    ```

  To run the default test scenario (e.g. End to End Scenario) on your own machine, use the following command:

  Maven:

  ```sh
  mvn clean test -P bstack-single
  ```

  Gradle:

  ```sh
  gradle clean bstack-single
  ```

  To run a specific test scenario, use the following command with the additional 'test-name' argument:

  Maven:

  ```sh
  mvn clean test -P bstack-single -Dtest=LoginDataDrivenTest
  ```

  Gradle:

  ```sh
  gradle clean bstack-single -Ptest-name=LoginDataDrivenTest
  ```

  where, the argument `test` or `test-name` can be any testclass implemented in this repository.

## Run your first Visual Test

In this section, we will run the test cases to detect the visual differences. We run the test first, then toggle the property that instructs our test to change some CSS.

1. Run the test.
   Maven:

```sh
npx percy exec -- mvn clean test -P percy
```

Gradle:

```sh
npx percy exec -- gradle clean percy
```

2. Set the `changeCSS` property in the `src/test/java/com/browserstack/test/login/LoginVisuaalTest` directory to true.

3. Run the test again.

4. View your Project in the Percy dashboard and verify the differences.

## Run the Ignore Region Test

In this section, we will run the test that ignores a specific area of a webpage. In a real-world situation, you can think of dynamic content and advertisements where this use case applies.

1. Run the test.
   Maven:

```sh
npx percy exec -- mvn clean test -P percy-ignore
```

Gradle:

```sh
npx percy exec -- gradle clean percy-ignore
```

2. View your Project in the Percy dashboard and verify the differences.
